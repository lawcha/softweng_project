Founded in Dublin in 1759, at first no one believed that stout, the beer brewed from roasted malt, would triumph. But Arthur Guinness proved the critics wrong, and today the dark ruby-colored beer is one of the most famous in the world. Guinness Draught has a lush, fine-pored foam and a malty flavor with distinct notes of licorice.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
